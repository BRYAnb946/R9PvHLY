# This script provides a basic example of how to implement XSS protection using Ruby and the CUBA framework.
# It demonstrates a simple method to sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.

# Simple helper method to sanitize input and prevent XSS attacks.
# It uses CGI.escapeHTML to convert HTML characters to their respective HTML entities.
